    "## Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "## The 3 States of Interest are Colorado, Illinois and Alaska.\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2017-2018, Colorado and Illinois show a gigantic jump in participation (from our previous Exploratory Data Analysis - we see that Colorado had a massive rise in participation from 11% to 100%,\n",
    "Significantly, though not up to 100%, Illinois increased SAT participation from 9% to 99% (11 times more).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alaska has got consistently low participation rates generally in 2018 for both tests. Though that seems unremarkable, it is of interest to us because the state had an almost 50% drop in ACT participation rates between 2017-2018, but unlike Colorado and Illinois, this was NOT followed by a huge spike in SAT participation in 2018 - it rose only by a mere 43%. This is worth investigating as a potential target State for the SAT to try to improve participation rates in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research and Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "The big question is why Colorado and Illinois had their participation rates shoot up. In both cases, the answer is successful state-wide mandatory SAT test-taking contracts were won by The College Board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Illinois' Education Board \"weighed the attributes of both exams and decided the SAT was better aligned with standards for what students should know in Illinois.\":https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-illinois-chooses-sat-met-20160211-story.html. Similarly, Colorado picked the SAT because of \"strong alignment to Colorado's academic standards and its free practice tools.\": https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/state-partnerships/colorado. Thus, the research indicates that the SAT looks like a more appropriate test from an academic suitability argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the SAT test's superiority is so compelling, that Illinois picked the SAT over the ACT despite the latter bidding 5.7m USD cheaper than The College Board's bid: https://chicago.chalkbeat.org/2018/7/27/21105418/illinois-has-embraced-the-sat-and-the-act-is-mad-about-it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Colorado and Illinois are certainly strong wins for SAT, but our dataset shows that the ACT is apparently ahead in participation rates (17 states with 100% participation). Recall our boxplot of participation rates from Data Visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, percentage rates are misleading - as they only show participation rates in individual States. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the absolute number of test-takers, SAT's successful contracts with Illinois and Colorado mandating SAT tests were 'instrumental' allowing SAT to overtake ACT as the market leader. As a result, in 2018, SAT test-takers rose to 2m, vs the ACT's 1.91m in 2018:\n",
    "https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/10/23/sat-reclaims-title-most-widely-used-college-admission-test/. This is of little surprise given that Illinois is home to Chicago, the 3rd largest US City by population: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the research above shows that the SAT is the better test, then states who appear \"on the fence\" with either test could be targets for State SAT exam mandates, like Alaska (whom we picked as a state to investigate). \n"

    "Based on your exploration of the data, what are you key takeaways and recommendations? Choose one state with a lower participation rate and provide a suggestion for how the College Board might increase participation amongst graduating seniors in this state. Are there additional data you desire that would better inform your investigations?"

    "## Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first conclusion is that participation percentage rates aren't everything - we must look at the absolute number of test takers too, given our revelation that the SAT has, in fact, been gaining ground since 2017 - which our data also showed in terms of the jump in participation rates. Research shows that in 2018, the SAT already overtook the ACT in terms of absolute test-taker numbers. How can we keep propelling this success?\n",
    "\n",
    "A first recommendation is to continue to go after States that have very high ACT participation rates. Repeating the success of SAT 'converts' like Colorado or Illinois will clearly improve participation rates, and obviously increase the absolute number of participants - because the students will have no choice. The College Board would literally be stealing away market share from The ACT.\n",
    "Still, government contracts typically have high barriers to entry. Thus, while it would be great to replicate Colorado again, we may look at lower-hanging fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second recommendation, then, would be to market the test directly to students in states who are 'on the fence' with participating in either test. To use Alaska as an example, we already know their participation rates were less than 50% in either test in 2018, indicating ambivalence to either test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our data also showed that States who had greater than 50% participation in both tests would tend to score poorly (see Exploratory Data Analysis), indicating that perhaps the students were overstretched in attempting two different exams. If it can be marketed to the students of \"ambivalent\" and \"overstretched\" States that statistically, students do better if they focus on the one test, why not share the Colorado/Illinois success story switching to the one test that was reportedly most appropriate - the SAT?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, any business plan to market towards students in any given State must not be made without contextual research. Alaska, as it turns out, would be a futile target for the SAT. They stopped all mandatory testing :https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/education/2016/06/30/students-no-longer-need-national-tests-to-graduate/. This happened in 2016, which partly explains the weak participation rates in our data generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, to highlight the importance of context, tests in general have reduced importance in places like Alaska. Its economy is driven mostly by low-tech industries, reducing the need for college education. According to Wikipedia, Alaska is \"the third-least populous and the most sparsely populated state... economy dominated by fishing, natural gas, and oil\". The US military also contribute significantly to the economy by employing many Alaskans: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, with this multi-pronged approach, and with considered thought into context, we would have a higher probability of furthering the ongoing success of the SAT.\n"
